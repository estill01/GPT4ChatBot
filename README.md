# ðŸ‘¾ GPT4ChatBot

> Not keen on 25 GPT-4 prompts every 3 hours? Me neither! Welcome to the free world.

Like every other dev on the planet, I built a quick GPT4 chat bot to get around the extreme ChatGPT web ui rate limiting.
Feel free to use this package, or go build your own bot (it's a modern dev rite of passage you know).

## Features
- Conduct and manage multiple chat threads
- Branch chat threads wherever and whenever you want
- Save all data locally in an easy to parse structure.
- Multi-level auto summary generation
  - The longer your thread, the higher-order summaries get generated
- Supports block and streaming output


## Usage
Initialize it with your OpenAI API key and start creating and managing chats


### Basic Usage
```
gpt4_chat_bot = GPT4ChatBot(api_key="your_openai_api_key_here")

# Create a new chat
chat_id = gpt4_chat_bot.create_chat()

# Submit a prompt and receive a response
response = gpt4_chat_bot.submit_prompt(chat_id, "What is the weather like today?", max_tokens=50)
print(response)

# Switch between chats or create new chats as needed
```

### Stream Responses to `stdout` or file
```
# Example usage with streaming
gpt4_chat_bot = GPT4ChatBot(api_key="your_openai_api_key_here")
chat_id = gpt4_chat_bot.create_chat()

# Stream to stdout (default)
response = gpt4_chat_bot.submit_prompt(chat_id, "What is the weather like today?", max_tokens=50, stream=True)

# Stream to a file
gpt4_chat_bot.set_stream_callback_to_file("stream_output.txt")
response = gpt4_chat_bot.submit_prompt(chat_id, "What is the weather like today?", max_tokens=50, stream=True)
```

## Features I'd Like To Add

These are individually pretty trivial to implement; Will add them as I have time.

**Keyword-based search**

Allow users to search for specific keywords or phrases within the chat messages across all branches. The chatbot can then display a list of matching branches or conversations, along with a brief summary or relevant excerpt for each.

**Chronological navigation** 

Enable users to navigate the chat history based on time or events, such as "go back to before we branched" or "go to the branch created on [date]". The chatbot can analyze the chat metadata to identify the appropriate branch or conversation and switch to it.

**Topic-based search**

Implement a topic detection system that identifies the main topic or subject of each chat branch or conversation. Users can then search for chats based on these topics, such as "go to the branch where we explored xyz".

**Semantic search**

Enhance the search functionality by using semantic similarity techniques to identify branches or conversations that are related to the user's query, even if they don't contain the exact keywords. This can help users find relevant chats more easily.

**Speach UI**
Integrate microphone + speaker access and run Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text.

**User profiles**

Create and manage User profiles which store preferences, chat history, and other personalization settings.

**Bot profiles**
Dynamically switch between 'fine tuning' bot profiles. Manage multiple instances of the bot.


** Sentiment analysis**

Implement sentiment analysis to gauge the mood of the user during the conversation. The chatbot could adjust its responses accordingly to maintain a positive and engaging experience, or other objectives.

**Language translation**

Add a translation feature that allows users to communicate with the chatbot in their preferred language. Auto-detect and translate messages into the desired language.

**Topic-based suggestions**

Detect the topic of conversation and offers relevant suggestions or information to the user. 

**Bot-initiated prompts**
Enable the bot to start conversations. (Hype don this / I should implement this..)

**Multi-user conversations**

Enable the bot to handle multi-user conversations where multiple people can interact with the bot and each other in the same chat thread. I.e. give it the ability to spawn an IRC / Discord server and jump in it.

**Chatbot training**

Enable the bot to process user-input and update it's `system` prompts to improve its informatation processing and response genreation.

**Cron-style scheduled prompts**

Schedule prompts to be sent at specific times or intervals. Useful for reminders, follow-ups, periodic check-ins, etc.

**Integration with external services**

Load it up with APIs / Integrate the auto-API finder project so it can do all the things.

**Emotion-aware responses**

Augment sentiment analysis with 'emotion detection' to better navigate user-interactions. Probably go all-in and also give the bot emotions. (lol?)
